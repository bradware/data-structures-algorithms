# Graph Search/Traversal Algorithms
Implementation of graph search/traversal algorithms including [Depth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) (DFS), [Breadth-First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) (BFS), and [Dijkstra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm). Each algorithm was implemented iteratively using either a [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)), [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)), or [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue). Implementation was done in Java and tested through the JUnit framework.
