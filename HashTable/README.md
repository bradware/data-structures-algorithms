# HashTable
Implementation of a [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) backed by an array. Collisions were handled through [Linear Probing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing). Load factor of the table was 0.75 before doubling in size. Hash table was implemented to store Generic types (T). Used Java for implementation and the JUnit framework for testing.
