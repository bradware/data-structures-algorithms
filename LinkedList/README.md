# Linked List
Implementation of a doubly [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubly_linked_list) with a head and tail pointer. Implemented with Java and tested extensively through the JUnit framework. The linked list is comprised of a Node wrapper class that stores Generic type data (T), next, and prev pointers.
