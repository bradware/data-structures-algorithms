# Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms
Implementation of a [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) (MST) and also algorithms to construct a MST. Strategies implemented to find a MST included [Kruskal's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm), [Prim's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm), and [Disjoint Sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_sets). Everything was built using Java and tested through the JUnit framework.
