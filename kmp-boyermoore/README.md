# KMP & Boyer-Moore
Implementation of the famous string search algorithms, [KMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%E2%80%93Morris%E2%80%93Pratt_algorithm) and [Boyer-Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyer%E2%80%93Moore_string_search_algorithm). Both were implemented in Java and tested through the JUnit framework. Each algorithm can be found in StringSearches.java file.
